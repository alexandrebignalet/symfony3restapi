Feature: Manage Account data through API

  In order to offer a User access to their Account resource via an hypermedia API
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to retrieve, create, update and delete JSON encoded Account resources.


  Background:
    Given there are Users with the following details:
      | uid  | username | email          | password |
      | u1   | peter    | peter@test.com | testpass |
      | u2   | john     | john@test.org  | johnpass |
      | u3   | dave     | dave@test.net  | davepass |
    And there are Accounts with the following details:
      | uid | name              | users |
      | a1  | account1          | u1    |
      | a2  | test account      | u2,u1 |
      | a3  | an empty account  |       |
    And I am successfully logged in with username: "peter", and password: "testpass"
    And when consuming the endpoint I use the "headers/content-type" of "application/json"


  Scenario: User can GET a Collection of their Account objects
    When I send a "GET" request to "/accounts"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the response header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json"
    And the response should contain json:
      """
      [{
          "id": "a1",
          "name": "account1",
          "users": [{

              "username": "peter",
              "email": "peter@test.com"
          }]
      }, {

  Scenario: User can GET an individual Account by ID
